Map Reduce Queue Should:

when jobs are enqueued only once:
   run all maps and 1 reduce

when jobs are enqueue multiple times:
   run all maps and 1 reduce at least 2 times, all the same number (not run 3 maps but only 2 reduces)

when maps throw error:
   reduce increments on progress, 
   trigger reduce job if progress reaches 0
   fill in error code into results
   not have job show in main error list

when maps crash worker.  on startup:
   reduce increments on progress, 
   trigger reduce job if progress reaches 0
   fill in error code into results
   not have job show in main error list -- tougher to do for now

when reduce throws error, or crashes and starts back up:
   reduce error should be in the running errors
   

progress should end up empty
results should end up empty
jobs should end up empty
assignment should end up empty
waiting should end up empty
